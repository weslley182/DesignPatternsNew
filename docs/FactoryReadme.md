# Factory Method Pattern

## âœ¨ Overview

The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by delegating object creation to subclasses.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Delegate the responsibility of creating objects to another class or method, instead of directly instantiating them using new in client code.

## ðŸ’¡ When to Use

- When you donâ€™t know in advance what types of objects your code will need.
- When you want to adhere to Open/Closed Principle.
- When you want to decouple object creation from its usage.

## ðŸ›  Example

This folder contains:

- `FactoryPatternExample` â€” The .NET code implementing the pattern.
- `FactoryPatternExampleTests` â€” Unit tests showing how to apply Factory in tests.
